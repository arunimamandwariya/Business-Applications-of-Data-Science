# Sales & Engagement Channel Strategy  

## Goal  
Evaluate effectiveness of digital and offline marketing channels in driving customer engagement and sales conversions.  

## Dataset  
- **10,000+ campaign records** across Email, SMS, Social Media, and Direct Calls.  
- Features included ad spend, customer demographics, and sales conversion outcomes.  

## Techniques  
- Regression Analysis (**OLS, ANOVA**) to quantify impact of marketing channels.  
- Model achieved **R² = 0.94**.  

## Results  

| Channel         | Effectiveness | Cost Efficiency | Key Insight                          |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Social Media    | High         | High            | Strongest ROI driver                  |
| Email           | High         | Medium          | Consistent engagement improvement     |
| SMS             | Low          | Low             | Minimal impact on conversions         |
| Direct Calls    | Medium       | Low             | High cost, weak conversion efficiency |

- **Ad budget emerged as strongest engagement driver**.  
- **Optimized channel mix** recommended → prioritize Social Media & Email, reduce spend on SMS and Calls.
- **Random Forest achieved 86% accuracy**, outperforming baseline Logistic Regression (~72%).  
- Top predictors: **income, prior credit usage, payment history**.  
- Proposed **segmentation framework** to target high-likelihood responders.
